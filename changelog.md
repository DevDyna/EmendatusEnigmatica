* Updated Ruby textures to have a bit more shine
* Added `forge:rods/all_metal` tag to all rods
* Added an option to switch from **SPREAD** to **RANGE** type of Ore Generation. It disabled by default. To use it, just set `*_use_spread = false` and it uses the current `baseline` and `spread` values to calculate the MinY and MaxY (Credit: [LatvianModder](https://github.com/Ridanisaurus/EmendatusEnigmatica/pull/124))
