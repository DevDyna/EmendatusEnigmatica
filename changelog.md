## Emendatus Enigmatica
#### MC 1.16.5 | Version 1.2.15

* Updated Ruby textures to have a bit more shine
* Added `forge:rods/all_metal` tag to all rods
* Added an option to switch from **SPREAD** to **RANGE** type of Ore Generation. By default, the system will continue to use **SPREAD** and to switch to **RANGE**, just set `*_use_spread = false`. It will continue to use the current `baseline` and `spread` values to calculate the MinY and MaxY (Credit: [LatvianModder](https://github.com/Ridanisaurus/EmendatusEnigmatica/pull/124))
